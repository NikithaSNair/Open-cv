# Face Detection with OpenCV

## Inspiration
This project was built to explore **face detection** using **OpenCV**. OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifiers make it easy to detect faces in real-time using your webcam.

## What it does
This project uses a webcam feed to detect faces in real-time. It utilizes OpenCV's **Haar Cascade Classifier** to recognize faces and draws rectangles around them.

## How we built it
- **OpenCV**: Used for face detection and image processing.
- **Webcam**: Captures real-time video feed to detect faces.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: A pre-trained model used to identify faces in the video frames.

### Key Libraries Used:
- `opencv-python`: For image processing and real-time face detection.
  
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Challenges we ran into
- Fine-tuning the face detection parameters to ensure accurate detection.
- Ensuring the webcam captures and processes frames quickly to maintain smooth face detection.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully implemented face detection using OpenCV with real-time webcam input.
- Efficiently used Haar Cascade Classifier for quick face recognition in video.

## What we learned
- How Haar Cascade Classifiers work for object detection.
- How to use OpenCV's video capture functionality.
  
## What's next for Face Detection with OpenCV
- Adding functionality for multiple face detection.
- Implementing additional features like emotion detection or integrating with other applications.
